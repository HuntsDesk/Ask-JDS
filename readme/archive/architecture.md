# Architecture

Summary to Send to the Other AI (Expanded):

Here‚Äôs an updated assessment based on our architecture:
	‚Ä¢	We are using Vite-only for our frontend build system, with no Node.js runtime. When we say ‚Äúnode,‚Äù we refer only to dev-time tooling (e.g., npm packages used via Vite), not runtime. All backend code runs in Supabase Edge Functions via Deno, not Node.
	‚Ä¢	Deno is the preferred execution environment for us‚Äîit‚Äôs modern, secure by default, and fully ESM-native. We avoid CommonJS, Node-specific modules, and require.
	‚Ä¢	We do not use .env.local, .env.development, etc. We maintain a single flat .env file across the project to avoid environment sync issues.
	‚Ä¢	Vite‚Äôs dependency optimizer (esbuild-based) caches and pre-bundles dependencies for performance. If you modify tsconfig.json, package-lock.json, or .env, Vite may invalidate the cache and re-optimize dependencies. Rapid or repeated changes to those files can result in ‚Äúoutdated optimized deps‚Äù errors or timeouts.
	‚Ä¢	The import_map.json files in Supabase functions are no longer needed if we‚Äôre using npm: specifiers with Deno‚Äôs latest version. Their removal is intentional and correct in this case.
	‚Ä¢	Our Vite version is 5.4.17, which is close to latest. Upgrading is fine if patch notes support it, but no downgrade is needed unless compatibility breaks.

Actions Taken / Confirmations:
	‚Ä¢	Vite is functioning as expected; we should avoid unnecessary config churn to prevent optimization errors.
	‚Ä¢	Supabase Edge Functions are configured to run with Deno-native syntax (Deno.serve, npm: specifiers).
	‚Ä¢	All .env logic should use a flat model; avoid Vite conventions that try to load .env.local or nested variants.

Cursor Rule Version (Compact and Persistent):

projectEnv: {
  runtime: "vite + deno (no node.js)",
  backend: "supabase edge functions (deno only)",
  frontend: "vite/react (ESM only)",
  env: "single flat .env only",
  denoImports: "use npm: or jsr:, never relative or node_modules",
  viteOptimizer: "uses esbuild to cache/pre-bundle deps; config/env/lockfile changes will trigger full reopt",
  viteVersion: "5.4.17; upgrade if needed but no downgrade required",
  importMaps: "deprecated in favor of npm: for deno"
}

üß† Clarification & Updated Context for Assessment

Thanks for the insights. After reviewing everything, I want to clarify our tech stack and expectations so we‚Äôre fully aligned:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Runtime Environment
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: We‚Äôre using Vite (currently vite@5.4.17, latest stable).
	‚Ä¢	This means we‚Äôre not using Node.js to run our app ‚Äî only as a runtime for Vite during dev/build.
	‚Ä¢	Any references to ‚ÄúNode‚Äù (e.g., .env.local, nested config behavior, CJS quirks) are likely not relevant to us.
	‚Ä¢	Backend: We‚Äôre using Supabase Edge Functions, which run in Deno.
	‚Ä¢	This means we benefit from modern ESM imports, native TypeScript, and security-first execution.
	‚Ä¢	We‚Äôre standardizing on Deno-style imports (npm: or jsr:), not Node-style require() or node: imports.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ .env Handling
	‚Ä¢	We use a single flat .env file at the project root (no .env.local, .env.development, or nested variations).
	‚Ä¢	Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to the frontend.
	‚Ä¢	Please assume one flat .env file is the canonical source of config.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Vite Optimizer (esbuild pre-bundling)
	‚Ä¢	Vite pre-bundles dependencies using esbuild, stored in .vite/ cache.
	‚Ä¢	Errors like ‚Äú504 (Outdated Optimize Dep)‚Äù typically mean:
	‚Ä¢	The dependency optimizer was interrupted
	‚Ä¢	Lockfile, tsconfig, or plugin state changed rapidly
	‚Ä¢	Our best practice when this occurs:

rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev



‚∏ª

‚úÖ Deno Import Maps & Supabase Functions
	‚Ä¢	Deno uses import_map.json for path aliasing and module resolution.
	‚Ä¢	These were previously present in:
	‚Ä¢	supabase/functions/create-payment-intent/
	‚Ä¢	supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/
	‚Ä¢	supabase/functions/_shared/
	‚Ä¢	Their removal may break imports unless all modules now use npm: or jsr: specifiers.
	‚Ä¢	We expect all Supabase Edge Functions to follow Deno-first practices, including:
	‚Ä¢	No require() or CommonJS
	‚Ä¢	No Node.js assumptions
	‚Ä¢	Only Deno.serve + native modules + compatible npm: imports

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Assessment of Your Suggestions (AI Review)
	‚Ä¢	Your suggestions about Node-based config nesting, .env.local behavior, and Node dependency trees are not applicable in our Vite/Deno-first stack.
	‚Ä¢	Please adjust your assumptions and recommendations to reflect:
	‚Ä¢	No Node runtime for the app itself
	‚Ä¢	No Next.js-style .env.* behavior
	‚Ä¢	No server-side CommonJS
	‚Ä¢	No need to polyfill Node APIs in the browser

‚∏ª

Let me know if you need a Vite config dump, a sample Edge Function, or package structure reference. We‚Äôre happy to align ‚Äî but we want the AI to reason with modern, ESM-first, Deno-safe assumptions.
