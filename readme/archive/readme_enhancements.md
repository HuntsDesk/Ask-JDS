# Potential Enhancements Using Flotiq

This document outlines additional data types that could be offloaded to Flotiq to improve performance and scalability of the main application database.

## Current Implementation

Currently, we are using Flotiq for:
- **Analytics Events** - Tracking user interactions, purchases, and engagement
- **Analytics Reports** - Storing aggregated metrics and analysis

## Additional Tables to Consider Offloading

### 1. Error Logs

**Why:**
- Error logs grow rapidly and can bloat the primary database
- They're rarely queried but important to retain for troubleshooting
- Often contain large payloads (stack traces, context objects)

**Proposed Flotiq Content Type:**

| Name | Type | Options |
|------|------|---------|
| error_type | Select | system, frontend, database, authentication, payment |
| severity | Select | critical, error, warning, info |
| message | Text | |
| stack_trace | Text area | |
| user_id | Text | |
| url | Text | |
| request_data | Rich text | |
| browser_info | Text | |
| created_at | Date time | |
| resolved | Checkbox | |
| resolution_notes | Text area | |

**Implementation:**
- Create error reporting utility that sends logs to Flotiq
- Add admin interface to view and filter errors

### 2. User Activity Logs

**Why:**
- Session data can be voluminous
- Useful for security and behavior analysis
- Not needed for core application functionality

**Proposed Flotiq Content Type:**

| Name | Type | Options |
|------|------|---------|
| action | Select | login, logout, password_change, settings_update, page_view |
| user_id | Text | |
| session_id | Text | |
| ip_address | Text | |
| user_agent | Text | |
| url | Text | |
| referrer | Text | |
| created_at | Date time | |
| metadata | Rich text | |

**Implementation:**
- Integrate with authentication flows
- Add activity tracking middleware

### 3. Content Caching

**Why:**
- Leverage Flotiq's strength as a headless CMS
- Offload static or semi-static content
- Reduce database queries for commonly accessed content

**Proposed Flotiq Content Type:**

| Name | Type | Options |
|------|------|---------|
| content_type | Select | course_description, faq, documentation, help_article |
| title | Text | |
| slug | Text | |
| content | Rich text | |
| metadata | Rich text | |
| published | Checkbox | |
| published_at | Date time | |
| last_updated | Date time | |
| version | Text | |
| author_id | Text | |

**Implementation:**
- Sync content from primary database to Flotiq
- Implement cached read-through pattern
- Update content in both systems when changes occur

### 4. Historical Enrollment Data

**Why:**
- After enrollments expire, they're rarely accessed
- Historical enrollments are valuable for analytics but not operations
- Reduces the size of the active enrollments table

**Proposed Flotiq Content Type:**

| Name | Type | Options |
|------|------|---------|
| original_id | Text | |
| user_id | Text | |
| course_id | Text | |
| course_title | Text | |
| enrolled_at | Date time | |
| expired_at | Date time | |
| renewal_count | Number | |
| payment_amount | Number | |
| payment_currency | Text | |
| payment_method | Text | |
| completed | Checkbox | |
| completion_percentage | Number | |

**Implementation:**
- Create a scheduled job to archive expired enrollments
- Maintain a "tombstone" record in primary database
- Update analytics queries to check both sources

### 5. Notification History

**Why:**
- Notification records grow quickly
- Rarely queried after sending
- Contains large template data

**Proposed Flotiq Content Type:**

| Name | Type | Options |
|------|------|---------|
| notification_type | Select | email, push, in_app, sms |
| user_id | Text | |
| subject | Text | |
| content | Text area | |
| template_id | Text | |
| variables | Rich text | |
| status | Select | sent, delivered, opened, clicked, failed |
| error_message | Text | |
| sent_at | Date time | |
| delivered_at | Date time | |
| opened_at | Date time | |
| clicked_at | Date time | |

**Implementation:**
- Integrate with notification system
- Add delivery status tracking
- Implement admin interface for notification history

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Prioritize Based on Impact:**
   - Start with tables growing fastest or causing performance issues
   - Focus on data rarely needed for active operations
   - Choose data with clear archiving criteria

2. **Implement in Phases:**
   - Complete analytics implementation first
   - Add error logging next (high impact, low complexity)
   - Phase in other tables as needed

3. **Synchronization Approach:**
   - For most data, use a one-way sync to Flotiq
   - For content caching, implement bi-directional sync
   - Create API abstractions to hide storage details from application code

4. **Retention Policies:**
   - Define clear retention periods for each data type
   - Implement automated archiving processes
   - Document data lifecycle for compliance purposes

## Benefits

1. **Performance:**
   - Smaller primary database means faster queries
   - Reduced backup and restore times
   - Lower memory requirements for database server

2. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - Specialized storage for each data type
   - Leverage free tier of Flotiq through partnership

3. **Scalability:**
   - Distribute data load across services
   - Scale components independently
   - Better handling of traffic spikes

4. **Maintainability:**
   - Cleaner database schema
   - Simplified data management
   - Better separation of concerns
