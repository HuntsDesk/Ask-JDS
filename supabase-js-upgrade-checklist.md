## Deployment Steps

1. [ ] Deploy all Edge Functions to verify compatibility with Supabase JS 2.39.3
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy create-payment-intent
   supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
   supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session
   supabase functions deploy create-customer-portal-session
   supabase functions deploy delete-flashcard
   supabase functions deploy chat-google
   supabase functions deploy chat-openai
   ```

2. [ ] Test each Edge Function with appropriate test cases
   - [ ] Test user authentication functions
   - [ ] Test payment processing functions
   - [ ] Test subscription management functions
   - [ ] Test chat functions

3. [ ] Verify application behavior with updated Supabase JS
   - [ ] Test authentication flows
   - [ ] Test database operations
   - [ ] Test realtime functionality

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered, roll back using the following steps:

1. [ ] Revert to the previous branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. [ ] Redeploy any problematic Edge Functions using the previous import maps
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy function-name
   ```

## Notes on Changes

- The upgrade from 2.38.0 to 2.39.3 includes better TypeScript support with improved type validation for query filter values.
- All import maps have been replaced with `deno.json` configuration files, following Supabase's recommended practice.
- No changes to the actual function code were required, as the API remains compatible.
