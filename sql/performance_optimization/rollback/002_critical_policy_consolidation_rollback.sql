-- Drop the consolidated policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards";
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anonymous users can view sample flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards";

-- Restore original 5 SELECT policies for authenticated users

-- 1. Restore admin access policy
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards"
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
        WHERE profiles.id = (select auth.uid()) 
        AND profiles.is_admin = true
    )
);

-- 2. Restore official flashcards access
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view official flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards"
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (is_official = true);

-- 3. Restore subscription user access
CREATE POLICY "Subscription users can view official flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards"
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
    is_official = true 
    AND (select auth.uid()) IN (
        SELECT user_id FROM user_subscriptions 
        WHERE status = 'active' 
        AND current_period_end > now()
    )
);

-- 4. Restore user ownership access
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards"
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING ((select auth.uid()) = created_by);

-- 5. Restore the multi-role public sample policy (serves both anon and authenticated)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view public sample flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards"
FOR SELECT TO anon, authenticated
USING (
    (is_official = true) 
    AND (is_public_sample = true)

-- Also restore the anon-specific sample policy if it existed
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view sample flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards"
