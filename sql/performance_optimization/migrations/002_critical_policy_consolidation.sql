-- Phase 2.1: Critical Policy Consolidation 
-- Target: flashcards table - 5 redundant SELECT policies for authenticated users
-- Impact: Resolves highest-impact Multiple Permissive Policy warning
-- Expected: 60% policy reduction for flashcards SELECT operations

-- PHASE 2.1: CRITICAL FLASHCARDS SELECT CONSOLIDATION
-- =============================================================================

-- CURRENT STATE: 5 separate SELECT policies for authenticated users on flashcards:
-- 1. "Admins can view all flashcards" 
-- 2. "Anyone can view public sample flashcards" (authenticated role)
-- 3. "Anyone can view official flashcards"
-- 4. "Subscription users can view official flashcards" 
-- 5. "Users can view their own flashcards"

-- TARGET: Single comprehensive policy covering all access patterns

-- Drop all existing redundant SELECT policies for authenticated users
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards";
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view official flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards";
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Subscription users can view official flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards";
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own flashcards" ON "public"."flashcards";

-- Note: Keep "Anyone can view public sample flashcards" policy as it serves both anon and authenticated
-- We'll modify it to only serve anon users to eliminate the authenticated overlap

-- First, check if the multi-role policy exists and handle it properly
