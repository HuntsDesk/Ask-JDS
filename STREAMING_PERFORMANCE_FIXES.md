# Streaming Performance Fixes

## Issues Addressed

1. **Slow streaming start (19+ seconds)**
   - Root cause: Edge function was buffering chunks before processing
   - Solution: Implemented immediate JSON object extraction and streaming

2. **"Gemini" references in console logs**
   - Replaced all "Gemini" references with generic "AI" terminology
   - Updated all console.log statements to use centralized logger

3. **Empty message bubble before streaming**
   - Fixed by delaying assistant message creation until first chunk arrives
   - No more empty bubbles shown to users

4. **Edge function streaming optimization**
   - Rewritten chunk parsing to process complete JSON objects immediately
   - Removed buffering delays
   - Improved JSON parsing logic for better performance

## Implementation Details

### 1. Logger Integration (src/lib/ai/gemini-provider.ts)
- Added logger import
- Replaced all console statements with logger calls
- Maintains same functionality with better production safety

### 2. Message Display Fix (src/hooks/use-messages.ts)
- Added `firstChunkReceived` flag
- Assistant message only added to UI on first chunk
- Subsequent chunks update existing message
- Fixed logger call signatures for TypeScript compliance

### 3. Edge Function Optimization (supabase/functions/chat-stream/index.ts)
- Implemented proper JSON object boundary detection
- Processes complete objects immediately without buffering
- Removed excessive logging for production
- Maintains streaming integrity

## Performance Impact

- **Before**: 19+ second delay before first response
- **After**: Should see first chunk within 1-2 seconds
- **User Experience**: No empty message bubbles, faster perceived response time

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test streaming with various message lengths
2. Monitor first chunk arrival time
3. Verify no empty message bubbles appear
4. Check console for any remaining "Gemini" references
5. Ensure edge function logs are minimal in production
