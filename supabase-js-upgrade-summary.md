# Supabase JS Upgrade Summary (2.38.0 to 2.39.3)

## Overview

This upgrade modernizes our Edge Functions to use Supabase JS 2.39.3, replacing the older import map approach with Deno's recommended `deno.json` configuration files. The upgrade provides better TypeScript support and bug fixes without requiring changes to our application code.

## Key Changes

1. **Updated Dependency Management**:
   - Migrated from import maps to `deno.json` configuration
   - All Edge Functions now use consistent import syntax with npm specifiers

2. **Version Benefits**:
   - Improved TypeScript type validation for query filter values
   - Enhanced support for enum types and nested relations
   - Better type inference for JSON fields
   - Various bug fixes related to authentication and PostgREST responses

3. **Standardized Configuration**:
   - Unified library versions across all Edge Functions
   - Added missing configuration files for functions that didn't have them
   - Ensured consistent compiler options across all functions

## Edge Functions Updated

- create-payment-intent
- stripe-webhook
- create-checkout-session
- create-customer-portal-session
- delete-flashcard
- chat-google
- chat-openai
- _shared (common utilities)

## Testing Notes

- The API structure remains compatible between versions
- No changes to endpoint URLs or request/response formats
- Functions should maintain backward compatibility

## Next Steps

See the accompanying `supabase-js-upgrade-checklist.md` for detailed deployment steps and testing procedures.
