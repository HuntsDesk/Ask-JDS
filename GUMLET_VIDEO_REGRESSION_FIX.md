# Gumlet Video Regression Fix

## üêõ Issue Identified

**Problem**: Video functionality was working previously but stopped working after recent deployments.

**Error**: 
```
GET https://video.gumlet.io/undefined/67479d574b7280df4bfa33c7/main.m3u8 404 (Not Found)
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue was **NOT** a missing environment variable on the hosting platform, but rather a missing environment variable in the **GitHub Actions deployment configuration**.

### What Happened:
1. ‚úÖ Local environment has `VITE_GUMLET_ACCOUNT_ID=6747983e53ef464e4ecd1982` 
2. ‚úÖ Hosting platform likely has the environment variable set correctly
3. ‚ùå **GitHub Actions workflow was missing the environment variable** during build process
4. ‚ùå Production builds deployed without the Gumlet account ID

### The Missing Piece:
In `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, the build steps had:
```yaml
env:
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL_PROD: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_URL_PROD }}
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_PROD: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_PROD }}
  # ... other env vars
  # MISSING: VITE_GUMLET_ACCOUNT_ID
```

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

Added the missing environment variable to **all three build steps** in the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
env:
  # ... existing variables ...
  # Video hosting  
  VITE_GUMLET_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.VITE_GUMLET_ACCOUNT_ID }}
```

**Updated sections:**
- `Build Ask JDS` job
- `Build JD Simplified` job  
- `Build Admin Panel` job

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Ensure GitHub Secret is Set**:
   - Go to GitHub Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Verify `VITE_GUMLET_ACCOUNT_ID` exists with value: `6747983e53ef464e4ecd1982`
   - If missing, add it

2. **Deploy**:
   - Push this change to trigger GitHub Actions
   - All three sites will rebuild with the correct environment variable

3. **Verify Fix**:
   - ‚úÖ Videos should load properly on all domains
   - ‚úÖ No more "undefined" in Gumlet URLs
   - ‚úÖ Course video playback restored

## üîß Additional Debugging Added

The code now includes enhanced error logging in `src/lib/gumlet.ts`:
- Logs when `VITE_GUMLET_ACCOUNT_ID` is missing
- Shows all available VITE environment variables
- Uses fallback to prevent "undefined" in URLs

## üéØ Expected Results

After the next deployment:
- ‚úÖ **Video URLs**: `https://video.gumlet.io/6747983e53ef464e4ecd1982/[assetId]/main.m3u8`
- ‚úÖ **Thumbnails**: Working properly
- ‚úÖ **Course playback**: Fully functional
- ‚úÖ **No 404 errors**: Gumlet resources loading correctly

## üí° Lesson Learned

**Always include ALL required environment variables in CI/CD pipelines**, even if they work locally. The deployment process can miss environment variables that exist in local `.env` files but aren't explicitly passed to the build process.

This is a common pitfall when:
- Environment variables work locally (from `.env` file)
- But CI/CD doesn't have access to those local files
- Each environment variable must be explicitly declared in the workflow
