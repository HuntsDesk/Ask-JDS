## Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Setup production environment
chmod +x scripts/setup-production-env.sh
./scripts/setup-production-env.sh

# 2. Build all domains
chmod +x scripts/build-production.sh
./scripts/build-production.sh

# 3. Verify builds
./scripts/verify-production-build.sh

# 4. Deploy (example for Vercel)
vercel --prod

# 5. Deploy edge functions

```

## Emergency Contacts

- **Technical Lead**: [Your contact]
- **DevOps**: [Contact info]
- **Database Admin**: [Contact info]
- **On-call rotation**: [Link to schedule]

## Rollback Procedure

1. **Immediate rollback**: Revert to previous deployment in hosting provider
2. **Database rollback**: Use Supabase point-in-time recovery if needed
3. **Edge function rollback**: Deploy previous version from Git
4. **DNS rollback**: Update DNS if domain changes were made

## Known Issues & Workarounds

- **Console statements**: 531 remaining, gradually being replaced
- **Bundle size**: Main bundle at 1MB (working on optimization)
- **Safari compatibility**: Storage manager utility available for issues

## Sign-off

- [ ] Development team approval
- [ ] QA team approval
- [ ] Product owner approval
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
