# Security Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for security implementation components before production deployment.

## Testing Environments

### Staging Environment Setup
- **Mirror Production**: Identical security configurations
- **Test Data**: Sanitized production data for realistic testing
- **Monitoring**: Same security dashboard and alerting setup

### Development Environment
- **Simplified Security**: Basic authentication, relaxed rate limits
- **Local Testing**: Docker containers with security components
- **Mock Services**: Simulated AWS WAF and CloudFront for local dev

## Component Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Schema Testing
**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Rate limiting function performance under load
- [ ] RLS policy enforcement with different user roles
- [ ] Index performance with large datasets
- [ ] Concurrent access and deadlock scenarios

**Test Data**:
- 10,000 simulated security violations
- 1,000 concurrent rate limit checks
- Various user tiers and subscription states

### Phase 2: Edge Function Security Testing
**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Rate limiting accuracy across user tiers
- [ ] Input validation with malicious payloads
- [ ] Performance under high request volume

**Security Test Payloads**:
```typescript
const xssPayloads = [
  '<script>alert("xss")</script>',
  'javascript:alert("xss")',
  '<img src=x onerror=alert("xss")>'
];

const sqlInjectionPayloads = [
  "'; DROP TABLE users; --",
  "' OR '1'='1",
  "UNION SELECT * FROM users"
];
```

### Phase 3: CloudFront Headers Testing
**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Header presence verification across all domains
- [ ] CSP policy effectiveness against XSS attacks
- [ ] Frame protection against clickjacking
- [ ] HSTS enforcement and preload functionality

**Testing Tools**:
- SecurityHeaders.com automated scanning
- OWASP ZAP security testing
- Browser developer tools verification

### Phase 4: AWS WAF Testing
**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Malicious request blocking effectiveness
- [ ] Rate limiting accuracy and performance
- [ ] False positive rate for legitimate requests
- [ ] Geographic blocking functionality

**Test Scenarios**:
- Simulated DDoS attacks
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attack vectors
- Legitimate high-volume traffic

## Integration Testing

### Cross-Component Scenarios
1. **Rate Limiting + WAF**: Ensure double-protection doesn't over-block
2. **CSP + WAF**: Verify violation reports reach database
3. **Dashboard + All Components**: Real-time data flow verification

### User Journey Testing
- **Registration Flow**: Security impact on new user signup
- **Payment Flow**: Stripe integration with security headers
- **Chat Flow**: Rate limiting impact on AI conversations
- **Admin Flow**: Enhanced security for admin operations

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Strategy
- **Baseline**: Performance before security implementation
- **Security Overhead**: Measure latency increase per component
- **Breaking Point**: Maximum load with security enabled
- **Recovery**: System behavior after security-triggered blocks

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: <50ms overhead target
- **Throughput**: Maintain 95% of baseline performance
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% false positives
- **Recovery Time**: <30s after legitimate traffic resumes

## Security Penetration Testing

### Automated Testing Tools
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security scanner
- **Nmap**: Network security scanning
- **SQLMap**: SQL injection testing
- **XSSHunter**: Cross-site scripting detection

### Manual Testing Scenarios
- Social engineering simulation
- Advanced persistent threat simulation
- Insider threat scenarios
- Multi-vector attack combinations

## Rollback Testing

### Rollback Scenarios
- **Immediate Rollback**: Critical production issues
- **Partial Rollback**: Specific component causing problems
- **Gradual Rollback**: Step-by-step component removal

### Validation Procedures
- System functionality after rollback
- Data integrity preservation
- User experience restoration
- Performance baseline recovery

## Documentation Requirements

### Test Reports
- [ ] Component test results
- [ ] Integration test outcomes
- [ ] Performance impact analysis
- [ ] Security effectiveness assessment

### Sign-off Criteria
- [ ] All critical tests passing
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Security team approval
- [ ] Stakeholder acceptance

## Continuous Testing

### Automated Testing Pipeline
- Daily security header validation
- Weekly penetration testing
- Monthly load testing with security enabled
- Quarterly comprehensive security audit

### Monitoring Integration
- Real-time test result monitoring
- Automated alerts for test failures
- Performance regression detection
- Security effectiveness trending
