# Ask JDS Platform

Multi-domain legal education platform serving AI-powered chat, courses, and flashcards from a single codebase.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Deno (for Supabase Edge Functions)
- Supabase CLI
- Stripe CLI (for webhook testing)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HuntsDesk/Ask-JDS.git
   cd Ask-JDS
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Note**: Development uses production database for streamlined workflow.

## Platform Overview

This monorepo powers three deployments from a single codebase:

- **[Ask JDS](https://askjds.com)** - AI-powered legal chat platform
- **[JD Simplified](https://jdsimplified.com)** - Legal education with courses and flashcards  
- **[Admin Panel](https://admin.jdsimplified.com)** - Administrative interface

All domains share the same Supabase backend, database, authentication, and UI foundations.

## Legal Document Management

The platform includes a comprehensive legal agreements system that automatically tracks user acceptance of Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Educational Disclaimer with full audit trails for compliance.

### Version Management

**Location**: `src/lib/legal-agreements.ts`

Legal document versions are centrally managed in the `LEGAL_DOCUMENTS` constant:

```typescript
export const LEGAL_DOCUMENTS = {
  terms: {
    version: "2025-01-15",           // Update this when terms change
    effectiveDate: "2025-01-15",    // Date new terms take effect
    displayTitle: "Terms of Service (v2025.1)"
  },
  privacy: {
    version: "2025-01-15",
    effectiveDate: "2025-01-15", 
    displayTitle: "Privacy Policy (v2025.1)"
  },
  disclaimer: {
    version: "2025-01-15",
    effectiveDate: "2025-01-15",
    displayTitle: "Educational Disclaimer (v2025.1)"
  }
} as const;
```

### Updating Legal Documents

**When terms/privacy/disclaimer change:**

1. **Update the content** in respective page components (`src/pages/TermsOfService.tsx`, etc.)
2. **Update version numbers** in `src/lib/legal-agreements.ts`
3. **Deploy changes** - existing users will see acceptance prompts for new versions
4. **Audit trail** - all acceptances are automatically logged with timestamps and IP addresses

### Database Schema

The `user_agreements` table tracks all legal document acceptances:

- `user_id` - Links to authenticated user
- `document_type` - 'terms', 'privacy', or 'disclaimer'  
- `version` - Which version was accepted
- `accepted_at` - Timestamp of acceptance
- `ip_address` - User's IP for legal audit trail
- `user_agent` - Browser information

**Security**: Full RLS policies ensure users can only view their own agreements, while admins can access all records for compliance auditing.

## Analytics Integration

The platform uses Usermaven for privacy-focused analytics across all domains.

### Configuration

**Location**: `.env` and `src/lib/analytics/usermaven.ts`

```bash
# Usermaven Analytics
VITE_USERMAVEN_KEY=your-usermaven-key
VITE_USERMAVEN_TRACKING_HOST=https://a.jdsimplified.com
```

### Key Features

- **Privacy-Focused**: Uses a white-labeled domain (`a.jdsimplified.com`) for first-party data collection
- **Cross-Domain Tracking**: Seamlessly tracks user journey across all domains
- **User Identification**: Associates analytics with user profiles when authenticated
- **Event Tracking**: Captures key user interactions throughout the application:
  - Authentication events (sign-ups, logins)
  - Chat interactions (thread creation, message sending)
  - Subscription events (checkout initiation, purchases)
  - Feature usage (courses, flashcards, content engagement)

### Implementation Details

- **Provider**: `UsermavenAnalyticsProvider` in `src/contexts/UsermavenContext.tsx`
- **Hook**: `useAnalytics` in `src/hooks/use-analytics.ts`
- **Debug**: Debugging interface available at `/debug/usermaven`
- **Security**: CSP headers configured to allow connections to the tracking domain

## Environment Configuration

Development uses production database for streamlined workflow:

```bash
# Core variables
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://prbbuxgirnecbkpdpgcb.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Domain configuration
VITE_ASKJDS_DOMAIN=askjds.com
VITE_JDSIMPLIFIED_DOMAIN=jdsimplified.com
VITE_ADMIN_DOMAIN=admin.jdsimplified.com

# Media CDNs
VITE_GUMLET_ACCOUNT_ID=your_gumlet_id      # Video CDN

# Analytics
VITE_USERMAVEN_KEY=your_usermaven_key
VITE_USERMAVEN_TRACKING_HOST=https://a.jdsimplified.com
```

### Environment Variable Handling

**Important**: Vite processes environment variables during build time, not runtime. This has important implications:

1. **Runtime Validation**: The application includes environment validation in `src/lib/env-utils.ts` that strictly checks for required variables.
2. **Stripe Integration**: Pay special attention to `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` as it's critical for payment processing.
3. **Local Development**: Always restart the dev server after changing `.env` files to ensure variables are properly loaded.
4. **Production Builds**: Environment variables must be available during the build process, not just at runtime.
5. **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter "Missing required environment variable" errors despite variables being in `.env`, try:
   - Ensuring the dev server was restarted after changes
   - Verifying the variable name matches exactly what's expected in validation
   - Running `npm run verify-env` to check if environment variables are properly embedded in builds
   - Checking that the validation code in `src/lib/env-utils.ts` correctly handles the variable
   - Ensuring your deployment pipeline includes environment variables during the build process

### Runtime Configuration System

The application includes a hybrid environment variable system that provides both build-time and runtime configuration:

1. **Build-time Variables**: Standard Vite environment variables processed during build
2. **Runtime Configuration**: `public/runtime-config.js` provides fallback values available at runtime
3. **Smart Fallbacks**: The system automatically falls back from build-time to runtime configuration

**Key Components:**
- `src/lib/env-utils.ts`: Unified environment variable access with fallbacks
- `public/runtime-config.js`: Runtime configuration for production deployments
- `scripts/verify-build-env.js`: Verification script to check environment variable availability

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
npm run verify-env    # Check if environment variables are properly embedded
npm run build         # Build all domains with environment variable injection
```

**Example validation code:**
```typescript
// src/lib/env-utils.ts
export function validateEnv<T extends Record<string, string>>(
  requiredEnvVars: Array<keyof T>,
  env: T
): T {
  for (const key of requiredEnvVars) {
    if (!env[key]) {
      throw new Error(`Missing required environment variable: ${String(key)}`);
    }
  }
  return env;
}
```
