## Future Enhancements

### Rich Text Editing for Lesson Content

Currently, lesson content uses a simple textarea that supports markdown. A future enhancement would be to add a rich text editor for lesson content, which would make it easier for content creators to format their lessons without needing to know markdown.

Potential implementations:
- [TipTap Editor](https://tiptap.dev/) - A headless rich text editor framework for React
- [React Quill](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill) - A Quill.js wrapper for React
- [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) - A rich text editor framework for React

Implementation steps would include:
1. Install the required packages
2. Create a `RichTextEditor` component
3. Replace the textarea in the `CreateLesson` component with the new rich text editor
4. Update the storage/retrieval of content to handle rich text content
